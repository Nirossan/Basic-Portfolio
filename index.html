  <h2><p style="font-size:1in; color:dodgerblue" >  About Me</h2>

  <img id="bio-image" src="./assets/images/niro.jpg" alt="Nirossan Vijayakumar" style="width:25%">

  <p>I am a detail-oriented and collaborative Electrical Engineering professional with 6 years of combined academic and industry experience, demonstrated software and programming skills, plus a remarkable ability to execute projects from ideation to testing, seeking a new, challenging role as Electrical and Electronic Engineer.
     
     I find myself strongly drawn to the unique working philosophy , and believe that I am well aligned to excel in the available opportunity.  
     
     Throughout the progression of my career, I have developed a highly-refined skillset centred on electrical engineering. Whether designing a prototype to facilitate wireless mobile charging, researching the feasibility of expanded electric and hybrid vehicle infrastructural support, or testing vehicles in an automotive plant to guarantee quality assurance, I have consistently demonstrated the skills needed to succeed as an electrical engineer.
